# CallSharp
Monadic exception handler for C#

This library is a logical successor for the [LeviySoft.Attempts](https://bitbucket.org/danslapman/attempts).
CallSharp provides extension methods instead of calling Try.Run<>(). Another benefit is that CallSharp eliminates the necessity
of defining tons of generic parameters without sacrificing convenience.
